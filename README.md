## 📌 Problem Statement

**Problem Statement X – Decentralized Disaster Relief**  
*Note: Replace "X" with the specific problem statement number and title from the Participant Manual.*

---

## 🎯 Objective

KarunyaSetu solves the inefficiencies, corruption, and delays in traditional disaster relief by providing a **decentralized platform** that ensures **instant aid delivery**, **privacy-preserving victim verification**, and **transparent fund management**. It serves **disaster victims**, **donors**, **NGOs**, and **governments**, offering a trustless, tamper-proof system to deliver aid where it’s needed most.

## 🧠 Team & Approach

### Team Name:  
KarunyaSetu Innovators

### Team Members:  
- Nandeesh ([Twitter](https://twitter.com/0x02Auditor)) – Smart Contracts, DAO Governance  
- Sribabu ([Twitter](https://x.com/5R1B4BU)) – Full Stack UI/UX & React  
- Bhanu Teja ([Twitter](https://twitter.com/BhanuTeja)) – Backend Integration  

### Your Approach:  
- **Why this problem?** Disaster relief is plagued by bureaucracy and mistrust. We aimed to leverage blockchain for transparency and efficiency.  
- **Key challenges addressed**: Implementing zkProofs for privacy-preserving verification, ensuring scalable DAO governance, and creating an intuitive UI.  
- **Breakthroughs**: Successfully integrated zkProofs with Aadhaar and GPS data, and built a DAO voting system that’s both secure and user-friendly.

## 🧪 How to Run the Project

### Requirements:
- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- MetaMask or compatible Web3 wallet
- Testnet ETH (via [Alchemy Sepolia Faucet](https://sepoliafaucet.com))
- .env file with API keys (if applicable)

### Local Setup:
```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/your-team/karunyasetu

# Install dependencies
cd karunyasetu
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

**Backend/Frontend Notes:**  
Frontend: Run `npm run dev` to start the React.js interface.  
Backend: Ensure Node.js APIs are running for victim validation.  
Blockchain: Deploy smart contracts on an EVM-compatible testnet (e.g., Sepolia) using Hardhat or Truffle.

## 🦠 Future Scope

📈 **Discord DAO Bot**: Real-time voting and fund updates.  
🛡️ **National Disaster Alert Integration**: Auto-trigger DAO proposals during crises.  
🌐 **Social Media Badges**: NFT/QR-coded donor recognition.  
🕒 **Live Timers**: For registration, voting, and funding phases.  
📊 **Donor Dashboards**: Personalized impact and giving history.
