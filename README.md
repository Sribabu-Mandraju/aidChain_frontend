# 🌐 KarunyaSetu – Decentralized Disaster Relief Fund Platform

KarunyaSetu is a Web3-based decentralized application (dApp) that leverages **DAO**, **DeFi protocols**, **zkProofs**, and **smart contracts** to ensure **transparent**, **automated**, and **trustworthy** fund distribution to disaster-affected victims. It empowers donors and communities to take direct control over humanitarian aid.

---

## 🔥 Problem We Solve

Traditional disaster relief systems are plagued by:
- ⚠️ **Delays** in fund distribution due to administrative inefficiencies.
- ❌ **Lack of transparency** in how donations are utilized.
- 🧾 **Fake claims**, middlemen, and fund mismanagement.
- 🚫 **No direct link** between donors and actual victims.
- 🕵️‍♂️ **Poor victim identity/location verification**.

## ✅ Our Solution – KarunyaSetu

### 💡 Key Features

- **🧠 DAO-Based Campaign Approval**: Disaster campaigns are proposed and voted on by DAO members.
- **🔐 zkProof-Based Victim Verification**: Victims are verified using Aadhaar pincode & geolocation through privacy-preserving zero-knowledge proofs.
- **💰 Smart Fund Management**: Fully automated fund distribution using Solidity smart contracts—no manual intervention.
- **🧾 On-Chain Transparency**: Every transaction is logged on the blockchain for real-time traceability.
- **🌍 Multilingual Chatbot**: Assists donors and victims in their native Indian languages.
- **🧠 Disaster Summary Bot**: Provides real-time disaster updates to DAO members before voting.
- **🎁 Donor Recognition via NFTs**: Donors receive unique NFTs as a token of gratitude.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|------------|
| **Smart Contracts** | Solidity |
| **Frontend** | React.js |
| **Backend/API** | Node.js, Flask |
| **Verification** | zkProofs (Zero Knowledge Proofs) |
| **AI Integration** | Groq (Multilingual chatbot & summary generator) |
| **Blockchain Interaction** | Base Onchain Kit, Wallets |

---

## 🔄 How It Works

1. **Campaign Creation**: DAO members propose relief campaigns.
2. **Community Voting**: The DAO votes on which campaigns go live.
3. **Victim Authentication**: Victims register using Aadhaar-based pincode + location zkProofs.
4. **Automated Fund Disbursement**: Funds are distributed through audited smart contracts.
5. **Donor Interaction**: Donors donate, receive NFTs, and monitor impact in real-time.

---

## 🧭 Future Plans

- 🤖 **Discord Bot**: Automate proposal, voting, and fund transfers within Discord.
- 📢 **Real-Time Disaster Alerts**: Auto-create DAO proposals based on national alert systems.
- 🎙️ **Voice-Activated Interaction**: Let users interact via voice in their native language.
- 📊 **Donor Dashboards**: Personalized insights on donations, campaigns, and DAO votes.
- 🪪 **Verified Donor Badges**: Shareable badges (via NFT or QR) for verified contributors.
- ⏲️ **Countdown Timers**: Urgency-driven donation/registration/claim periods.
