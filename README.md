# 🌪️ KarunyaSetu: Decentralized Disaster Relief Protocol

![KarunyaSetu Logo](images/logo.png)

**KarunyaSetu** is a **decentralized disaster relief platform** powered by smart contracts, DAO governance, zkProofs, and multilingual AI assistants.

The protocol ensures **instant aid delivery**, **on-chain transparency**, and **real-time governance**, redefining the way communities respond to crises.
