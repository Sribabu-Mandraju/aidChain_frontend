## Introduction

**KarunyaSetu** is a **decentralized disaster relief platform** powered by smart contracts, DAO governance, and zkProofs. Designed to eliminate corruption, delays, and inefficiencies in traditional systems, KarunyaSetu connects **verified victims** with **compassionate donors** in a transparent, automated, and tamper-proof environment. The protocol ensures **instant aid delivery**, **on-chain transparency**, and **real-time governance**, redefining how communities respond to crises.

## 🚨 The Problem We Solve

Traditional disaster relief is broken:

- ❌ **Delayed fund distribution** due to bureaucracy.
- 🧾 **Fake claims & middlemen** siphoning away resources.
- 🤝 **No direct channel** between donors and real victims.
- 🔒 **Lack of privacy** & identity verification for victims.
- 🔍 **Limited visibility** into how funds are used.

- 🔐 **Zero-Knowledge Verification** – Aadhaar pin + geolocation without exposing identities.
- 🧠 **DAO-Driven Campaigns** – Relief campaigns proposed and approved by the community.
- 💸 **Smart Fund Automation** – Transparent, trustless fund disbursement to verified victims.
- 🎁 **NFT Gratitude Tokens** – Donors receive unique NFTs as badges of contribution.
